							A web application that allows you to analyze and export your
							Spotify playlists. Spotify playlists are fetched from the official
							Spotify API.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Please note that only playlists may be analyzed and exported
							</strong>
							. No albums, podcasts or any other kind of media will get through
							the fetching and parsing process.
						</p>
						<p>
							Analyzing a playlist will provide you with many interesting
							insights. You may learn the most repeated artist of the playlist,
							oldest and youngest song, and more.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition, you can export your playlists as JSON or CSV files.
							You may choose between a simpler data set, including only the
							names of the artists, albums and songs, or a more detailed data
							set, including more in-depth information about the included albums
							and e.g. the contributor of any given song.
						</p>
						<p>
							Originally I got the idea for the playlist exporting as I realized
							there was no way to export a playlist from Spotify. I wanted to
							have a backup of my playlists in case something would happen to my
							account.
						</p>
						<p>
							{`Analyzing the playlists was a natural addition to the project. The
							analyzing features are still under construction. Don't know yet how
							I'll expand this feature set.`}
